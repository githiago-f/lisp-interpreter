# lisp-interpreter

> This project does NOT mean to implement all lisp's features, so don't use this in production or else where (is just a study project).

## About 

This project will implement, test and create examples of using lisp as a DSL, wich will be ran ant top of javascript's V8.
It will not have a realy huge ammount of features, so, `never` try to use that in production. It is not a production ready interpreter. This is just a really small and nonprofit study, and will never be like a real compiler or interpretter for any language.

If you want to test this application, create a `.lsp` file at somewhere, execute `node .` and pass by your file's name to `--path=/path/to/file.lsp`. If the commands are valid and defined at `commands` section, it will be executed.

Your code .lsp will be ran using nodejs's structure.

This is not a union of nodejs and lisp, so, not all commands of either will be accessible for your lsp code.
